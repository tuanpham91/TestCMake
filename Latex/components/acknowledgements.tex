First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Mingchuan Zhou for his enthusiasm towards this project, endless patience and  willingness to discuss about a problem for hours to figure out the solution together. I also would like to say special thanks to Manuel Viermetz for some excellent advice and last-minute proofreading. Lastly, I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support not only during my academic career but throughout my entire life.
